# PhantomAuth â€“ Invisible 2FA System

PhantomAuth is a smart security solution that silently verifies user identity using keystroke dynamics and behavioral biometrics. It captures how users type and interact with their keyboard and mouse, generating a unique behavioral profile used as an invisible layer of 2FA.

## Modules
- Frontend: Captures keystrokes and mouse behavior.
- Backend: Trains user-specific profiles and authenticates attempts.
- ML: Classifies login behavior against stored profiles.

## Run Instructions

1. Install dependencies
